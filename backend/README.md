# My Content Tracker

I use multiple websites to track my content partnership - negotiation, content creation rates, production process, and
follow up.

To make it more convenient and build my fullstack software development skills, this application will be a WIP to make my
life (and possibly those of other content creators) much easier.

This `backend` repository serves as the Java Spring Boot application for the backend of the platform.
## Setup dependencies
```shell
./gradlew clean build
```

## Run the application
```shell
./gradlew bootrun
```
